# Optimisation examples

this folder contains a few examples of optimisation with python.

We can define 'optimisation' as the process of searching for some parameters that best meet some criteria'. Like any other search you might carry out, there are going to be a few considerations:

- You want the search to be as quick as possible
- You want the search to be as efficient as possible 

The approach that will help you find the best parameters quickly and efficiently is extremely situation dependant! I am going to cover a few practical examples that I have come across during my career, covering linear optimisation and bayesian optimisation. see the slides for more detail.
